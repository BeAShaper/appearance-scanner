          Coherent Point Drift (CPD) Matlab package (version 2.1)
	       Copyright (C) 2006-2009, Andriy Myronenko


This package provides Matlab code with examples for 
the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm. The description of 
the CPD algorithm can be found in 

	Myronenko A., Song X.(2009), "Point-Set Registration: Coherent Point Drift.", Technical Report, OHSU 
        download at http://www.bme.ogi.edu/~myron/matlab/cpd/


1) INSTALLATION

Unpack the CPD distribution archive.
Add 'CPD' directory with all subdirectories to the Matlab path.
Run cpd_make (in Matlab) to mex-compile some essential files.


2) EXAMPLES

Please see many examples in the 'examples' directory for the details.

5) Fast Gauss Transform (FGT) mex implementation
The code provides a possibility to use FGT (optionally) to speedup some computations.
The FGT implementation is by Sebastian Paris, see 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/17438.
